///
/// \brief The QXmppRosterManager class provides access to a connected client's
/// roster.
///
/// \note Its object should not be created using its constructor. Instead
/// \c QXmppClient::findExtension<QXmppRosterManager>() should be used to get
/// the instantiated object of this class.
///
/// It stores all the Roster and Presence details of all the roster entries
/// (that is all the bareJids) in the client's friend's list. It provides the
/// functionality to get all the bareJids in the client's roster and Roster and
/// Presence details of the same.
///
/// After the QXmpp connected successfully to the XMPP server the signal
/// \c QXmppClient::connected() is emitted and the roster is requested from the
/// server. Once QXmpp receives the roster the signal
/// \c QXmppRosterManager::rosterReceived() is emitted and after that the
/// methods of this class can be used to get the roster entries.
///
/// \c QXmppRosterManager::isRosterReceived() can be used to find out whether
/// the roster has been received yet.
///
/// The \c itemAdded(), \c itemChanged() and \c itemRemoved() signals are
/// emitted whenever roster entries are added, changed or removed.
///
/// The \c presenceChanged() signal is emitted whenever the presence for a
/// roster item changes.
///
/// \anchor rostermanager_moved
/// ## XEP-0283: Moved
///
/// \xep{0283, Moved} provides a way to inform other users that an account has moved. This allows a
/// presence subscription request from a new account to be automatically linked to the old account.
/// However, this requires verification via a corresponding PubSub node on the old account.
///
/// The roster manager automatically checks entries using the QXmppMovedManager. For this to work,
/// the moved manager must be added to the QXmppClient. If the moved manager is not found or the
/// specified old JID is incorrect, the entry in the presence subscription request will be removed.
///
/// The received and verified presence subscription request is emitted via
/// subscriptionRequestReceived() and the old JID can be found in QXmppPresence::oldJid().
/// It is safe to assume that this old JID is valid since QXmpp 1.10.2.
///
/// Accepting moved subscription requests automatically is discouraged in
/// [section 4.3](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0283.html#receive-notification-client) of the
/// XEP.
///
/// ### Behaviour in previous versions
///
/// Support in the roster manager and in QXmppPresence was initially added in 1.9.0.
///
/// In QXmpp 1.9.0 until 1.9.4 and 1.10.0 until 1.10.1 subscription requests with a Moved element
/// are verified and automatically accepted without emitting subscriptionRequestReceived(). If
/// verification fails, the **invalid** old JID is passed in subscriptionRequestReceived()!
